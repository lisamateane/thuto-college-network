# Client Requirements — CMPG325-2026-023

## Client Details
- **Client ID:** CLI-023
- **Organisation:** Thuto Skills Training College (Klerksdorp)
- **Industry:** Education

## Project Scope
Design and simulate a computer network for Thuto Skills Training College 
that provides appropriate connectivity and network services, using Cisco 
Packet Tracer.

## Core Requirements (from brief, Section 6)
1. Use the assigned addressing block **10.18.0.0/16** as the basis of the 
   IP addressing plan.
2. Provide appropriate connectivity and network services for the assigned 
   scenario (education/training college).
3. Accommodate the stated design constraint and change request (below).
4. Produce a working, testable Packet Tracer implementation (.pkt file).

## Design Constraint (Section 8)
> Boardroom requires dedicated wireless and wired presentation ports.

This means the boardroom must have both a wired network port (for a 
laptop/PC presenting) and wireless access (for guests/staff presenting 
from their own devices).

## Assigned Networking Challenge (Section 9)
**VLAN Trunking (802.1Q across switches)** — Advanced difficulty.

Must configure, verify, and demonstrate 802.1Q trunking between at least 
two switches, and be able to explain what was configured, why it's 
appropriate, and how it was verified.

## Client Change Request (Section 10)
**CR9:** One off-site administrator requires secure remote management 
access to network devices.

This means at least one network device must be configurable/manageable 
remotely, using a secure protocol (not plain-text access).

## Testing Requirements (Section 11)
- Test relevant end-to-end connectivity.
- Verify the assigned networking challenge (VLAN trunking) works.
- Capture clear evidence (screenshots) of successful operation/configuration.
- Document important troubleshooting performed.
- Ensure the final .pkt file opens and reproduces the working solution.

## Note on Scope
The brief does not specify exact departments, device counts, or room 
layout for Thuto Skills Training College. Per lecturer guidance, 
reasonable assumptions were made where the brief is silent — these are 
documented separately in `assumptions.md`, not invented as if they were 
official client requirements.
